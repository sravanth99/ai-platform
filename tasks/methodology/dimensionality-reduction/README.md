# Dimensionality Reduction
**Goal**
* The goal of this task  is to visualize the higher dimensional data using some dimensionality reduction techniques.
* We humans don't  have the ability to visualize the data that is higher than 3D .
* 2 techniques were used to convert higher dimension to lower ( 2D or 3D).

**Techniques**
* There are a bunch of techniques to reduce the dimensionality but we are going to use PCA ( the simplest technique )  and t-SNE ( The most effective technique). 
* The drawbacks of PCA are discussed in the source code.
**Ouput**
* We are able to visualize the high dimensional (784-D) data  in 2D using PCA and t-SNE.
